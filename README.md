# NTHU-ATLAS Expt HEP Beamer(Slides) Template
This is the normal (default) template for writing reports in the NTHU.\
It's recommended to use Overleaf to use it.\
This latex beamer template is a modified fork from the template created by PolyU by Rui Song.

This template of beamer is for the (weekly) meeting in NTHU Expt. HEP Group. Before you use it, please make sure you have read the [example](../NTHU_ATLAS_Expt_Beamer_Slides.pdf) and [sty](../nthu-atlas.sty) files first.

If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to contact me at yygarypeng@gapp.nthu.edu.tw.

You can check the original template created by PolyU in [the Overleaf Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/polyu-beamer-slides/pyhhgmgmvzhg).

> This template needs to use _**pdflatex**_!
